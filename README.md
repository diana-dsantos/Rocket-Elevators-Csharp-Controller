# Rocket-Elevators-Csharp-Controller

Odyssey Program - Week 3 - The Mechanics of Compiled Languages.

The program is a controller installed in a building of 66 floors, comprising 6 sub-sectors served by 4 columns of 
5 elevator bars each. In the classic model, these columns respectively serve these floors (B6 to B1) + RC, (2 to 20) + RC, 
(21 to 40), (41 to 60), respectively. For moderns, each column will serve the RC: (B6 to B1) + RC, (2 to 20) + RC, (21 to 40) + RC, (41 to 60) + RC.

contains the Csharp files for the commercial controllers and the document contains test scenarios.

Csharp: To test the Scenario remove the "//" in "assingnElevator(l:121) and "/*" before the scenarios(l:454).
